# Syncing

## ッツ

To sync a book in ッツ you can either choose to manually sync (recommended) or enable auto sync.
Regardless of the syncing method, you should **ALWAYS** use the Browser source when reading.

### Auto Sync

In Settings -> Data select `All` for `Auto Import/Export`

<img src="Pictures/gdrive_23.png" width="80%" alt="">

### Manual

In Settings -> Data, I recommend choosing "Overwrite" for "Import/Export Behavior" to prevent being unable to overwrite local/remote bookmarks because you loaded into the book.

#### Syncing to Google Drive
To sync a book to Google Drive, make sure you're using the browser source.

Select the book and press on the cloud symbol at the top.

Tick the data you want to sync, Hoshi Reader supports syncing book data, bookmarks, statistics and audiobook progress. Book Data only has to be synced once and can be unticked in subsequent syncs.

You will want to sync after each reading session, or when you want to swap devices.

#### Syncing from Google Drive

To sync back a book from Google Drive after you've synced to Google Drive from a different device, simply swap to the GDrive source and follow the exact same steps but choose `Browser DB`.

**SWAP BACK TO THE BROWSER SOURCE TO READ**

## Hoshi Reader

Screenshots will show the iOS version, steps for the Android version are similar.

Make sure sync is set up and you're connected. To enable syncing for statistics and audiobook progress, enable the options in `Advanced` -> `ッツ Sync` or in their respective settings menus.

<img src="Pictures/gdrive_26.png" width="40%" alt="">

You can use Auto Sync in Hoshi Reader which will periodically queue syncs while you're reading or on specific triggers like exiting the reader or backgrounding the app. If you foreground after the app was backgrounded for an extended period of time, it will automatically try to pull a newer bookmark from Google Drive. Auto Syncing will slightly slow down opening books.

If you prefer manually syncing. You can long press a book in the library and tap on sync. If the direction is set to auto, it will try to auto resolve the newer bookmark and either import or export. If you set direction to manual in settings, you can choose the sync direction.
