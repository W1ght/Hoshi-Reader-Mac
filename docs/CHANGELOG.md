# Hoshi Reader Mac Changelog

This changelog records user-visible changes only. Implementation details, investigation logs, and temporary experiments belong in commits, issues, or focused design docs.

## Unreleased

- Added a Video anime-card mining flow that captures the current frame and selected subtitle audio range for AnkiConnect media fields, plus an Anki Settings helper for common video card mappings.
- Added Video pointer-revealed playback chrome that auto-hides on idle or app/window exit, uses a compact IINA-like draggable control surface, single-click play/pause, double-click full screen, subtitle, volume, track, and shortcut-summary controls.
- Changed the macOS app bundle identifier to `moe.shishamo.hoshi`.
- Raised default Video subtitle placement so captions are not covered by the compact playback controls.
- Added Video drag-and-drop import for media and SRT/VTT subtitle files, and preserved playback when switching from Video to other sidebar sections and back.
- Added Video subtitle appearance controls for font and size, with asbplayer-style defaults, plus mask controls for blurring or hiding text subtitles until pointer hover.
- Added a Video mining history sidebar that records subtitle mining attempts, tracks Anki result status, and can jump back to the mined subtitle without covering the video.
- Fixed SVG and other Reader images being cropped or rendered incorrectly in the native macOS full-screen image preview.
- Restored Catalyst-style Reader layout so text uses the full available viewport and only applies the reader margins chosen in Appearance.
- Expanded the native Reader into the top safe area so vertical pages can use the titlebar band instead of leaving a large blank strip.
- Fixed Reader previous/next shortcuts changing chapters before the final partial page had been displayed.
- Fixed Sasayaki playback shortcuts so `P` continues to play/pause while the Sasayaki panel is open.
- Fixed Reader previous/next shortcuts firing twice when the focused WebView also received the same key event.

## 0.4.2

- Fixed vertical reading pages where some EPUBs could show text from adjacent pages stuck together or overlapping at pagination boundaries.
- Aligned vertical reader page sizing and bottom spacing with upstream behavior while preserving Mac horizontal overflow protection.
- Restored direct switching between Books, Dictionary, and Settings from the reader so returning to Books can continue the current reading session.

## 0.4.1

- Added dictionary entry navigation shortcuts for lookup results.
- Added shortcut settings for previous and next dictionary entry navigation.
- Improved highlighting and scrolling for the current dictionary entry in popup and nested popup results.

## 0.4.0

- Merged recent upstream reader and dictionary behavior with Mac Catalyst adaptations.
- Improved reader full-screen and chrome layout so the reading area uses more of the window.
- Fixed reader white-screen and vertical pagination display regressions.
- Added right-click delete actions for highlights and dictionary entries to match trackpad swipe delete behavior.
- Improved localization coverage for new settings surfaces.
- Improved Google Drive progress sync behavior around unchanged progress across days.
